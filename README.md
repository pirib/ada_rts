ADA_RTS
=======

This is our project for Real Time Systems subject. We have cleaned up and removed extra code, just leaving the essential bits. Ada_project repository has all the experimental features.

The project was a simple self-driving car which would use one frontal ultra sound sensor to avoid collision. 

PS: Limitations of ADA on Microbit forced us to write a sub-optimal code for a Real-Time System, so take the implementation with a pinch of salt.
